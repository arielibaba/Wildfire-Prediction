# Wildfire-Prediction

This project deals with the prediction of the evolution of fires using machine learning.
The goal is to determine when a fire is going to become "critical".
More precisely, we build an ML model which predicts if any existing fire will burn a "critical" amount of acres within the next 6 hours (the considered prediction horizon). 

The complete approach is described in [this Medium article](https://medium.com/atoti/prediction-of-wildfire-using-machine-learning-c4d91f8a926b).
