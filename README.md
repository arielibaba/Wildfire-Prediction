# Wildfire-Prediction

This project deals with the prediction of the evolution of fires using machine learning.
The goal is to determine when a fire is going to become "critical".
More precisely, we build an ML model which predicts if any existing fire will burn a "critical" amount of acres within the next 6 hours (the considered prediction horizon).
